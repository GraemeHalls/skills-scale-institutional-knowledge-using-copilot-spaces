# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation Hub! This collection of documents provides a comprehensive guide to how OctoAcme runs projects, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a **customer-first, iterative delivery approach** designed to ship value incrementally while maintaining high quality standards and clear accountability. Our project management framework emphasizes:

- **Iterative Delivery**: Breaking work into small, testable increments that deliver value early and often
- **Clear Ownership**: Every project has designated Product and Project Managers with well-defined responsibilities
- **Data-Informed Decisions**: Measuring impact and iterating based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Risk Management**: Proactive identification and mitigation of risks and dependencies
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives and actionable learnings to enhance our processes
- **Psychological Safety**: Encouraging open feedback, experimentation, and learning from failures

### Key Workflows

Our project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible approach:

1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, align stakeholders, and define success metrics
2. **Planning**: Create actionable backlogs, estimate work, and map dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, and deliver in iterative cycles with daily coordination
4. **Release**: Deploy with confidence using standardized processes and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and drive continuous improvement

### Roles & Personas

OctoAcme projects involve clear roles with distinct responsibilities:

- **Product Managers (PdM)**: Define what to build, prioritize the roadmap, and measure outcomes
- **Project Managers (PM)**: Coordinate delivery, manage schedules, risks, and communications
- **Developers**: Design, build, test, and deliver software components
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input, approvals, and support

### Communication Strategies

We maintain alignment through structured communication:

- **Daily standups** for delivery teams (15 min, focused on progress and blockers)
- **Weekly syncs** between PM and Product Lead
- **Twice-weekly standups for delivery team** (or as agreed)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**
- **Sprint/milestone demos** to showcase progress
- **Ad-hoc escalations** following defined escalation paths

### Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is embedded throughout our delivery process:

- Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing requirements
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with security scanning
- Code review requirements (at least one approval)
- Definition of Done for all backlog items
- Pre-release smoke testing and rollback plans
- Post-deployment verification and monitoring

## How to Use This Documentation

### For New Team Members

1. Start with the **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** to understand our principles and approach
2. Review **[Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** to understand your role and how you'll interact with others
3. Familiarize yourself with the project lifecycle guides in order (Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective)

### For Project Managers

- Use the lifecycle guides as checklists for each project phase
- Keep the Risk Register and project artifacts updated in your project repository
- Reference the communication templates for consistent stakeholder updates

### For Product Managers

- Leverage the **[Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** when evaluating new opportunities
- Use the one-pager template to align stakeholders on goals and success metrics
- Partner with your PM using the defined communication cadence

### For Developers

- Review **[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** for workflow conventions and quality standards
- Use acceptance criteria and Definition of Done to guide your work
- Participate actively in retrospectives to improve team processes

### Integrating with Copilot Spaces

To make these documents available as context for GitHub Copilot:

- Copy relevant process docs into your project's `.copilot/` directory
- Reference specific guides in your project README or charter
- Keep project-specific artifacts (charters, roadmaps, risk registers) in your project repository

## Contributing to This Documentation

These documents are living artifacts that should evolve with our practices:

- Submit improvements via pull requests
- Share feedback from retrospectives that could improve our processes
- Update templates based on lessons learned from actual projects
- Keep documentation aligned with how we actually work, not how we wish we worked
